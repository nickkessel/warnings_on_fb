## What it does:
1. Scrapes the publicly-facing [NWS alerts api](https://api.weather.gov/alerts/active) for chosen alerts in a chosen bounding box (see [supported alerts](#supported-alerts) and [areas](#supported-areas) for more info)
2. Generates a polygon from the alert geometry
3. Uses open-source GIS tools to add in US highways, interstates, county/state borders, and city names onto the selected map area. 
4. Overlays radar context using nearest-site NEXRAD Level II, Level III, or NCEP MRMS. Level II supplies high-resolution base reflectivity; Level III supplies derived hydrometeor classification and one-hour rainfall products. If the selected NEXRAD source is unavailable, stale, or out of range, the program automatically falls back to MRMS.
5. After the graphic is generated, it can go to any number of end users. Currently supported are sending to a Facebook page and/or Discord server. Instagram posting is possible, but not available at-scale/for more than a metro-area or two worth of alerts. Also included in the download is the `slideshow.py` file, which uses `pygame` to create an auto-updating slideshow with all active alerts.

## Supported Areas:
- Complete support of CONUS
- Complete support of Alaska
    - Uses cities dataset w/ smaller cutoff for greater usability
- Near-complete support of Puerto Rico (no roads available to plot)
- Near-complete support of Hawaii
    - No known issues, but more testing is needed
- No support of Guam
    - No dataset for Guam cities
    - Issues with plotting MRMS data on Guam domain
## Running It:
- download the latest release (wheel)
- create a new virtual environment
- activate the virtual environment
- duplicate an existing config file, adjust settings to your domain/needs, set warnings to target
- set `USE_NEXRAD = "LEVEL2"` or `"LEVEL3"` to select nearest-site NEXRAD radar; set it to `False` for MRMS
- set `NEXRAD_SMOOTHING = True` to lightly smooth plotted Level II/III fields; this setting does not affect MRMS
- create a .env with a FACEBOOK_PAGE_ACCESS_TOKEN, FACEBOOK_PAGE_ID, IG_USER, IG_PASS, if you want alerts to be sent to those places
- rename the config file to something relevant to your use, keep it in the /configs folder.
- run  `python -m insta_alert.main --config {YOUR_CONFIG_NAME}`
- enjoy!

## Contributions: 
Want to contribute? Great! Each main project `.py` file has a cluttered list of TODOs at the top, with general ideas for improvements and fixes. Some of these might be completed but not checked off, or not applicable any more. For a more structured list of needs, check out the [Issues](https://github.com/nickkessel/warnings_on_fb/issues) page on the repository. I'd say that the biggest needs right now are more testing of different types of alerts in unusual areas (and just general resiliency), improving the caption/details text, and adding more integrations (Instagram/Meta Business Suite being the biggest).
